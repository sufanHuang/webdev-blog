##### Amazon Certified Cloud Practitioner and Me

I received an invitation to go to a recruiting event from HackerX on Auguest 29th, 2019. I updated my portfolio site 
and  printed out around 10 copies of resume, together with some anxiety and curiosity, I 
arrived on time.

I didn't draw a big picture for myself, but carried with an attitude of finding out what technologies are popular in 
Des Moines, as well as how far I am compared with their ideal candidates. 

I talked to around 6 employer on site. There two things I found out: 1. Everyone is using cloud technology, with AWS
as the more popular one. 2. The employers are interested in my attitude and the scope of technology I knew about,
but they are not quite sure of my coding skill. 

This is a very important action piece in my journey of becoming a professional web development. I gave myself some time to think
it through and set two goals: 1. Take AWS exams and get couple certifications. 2. Continue to make projects and start 
to document the thinking process as well as problem solving process. 

Prior to this decision of diving into AWS, I have make a simple project using AWS lambda, dynamoDb, apiGate way. It took 
me a whole month to figure out different parts and how to put them together using serverless framework. Even after this project, 
the AWS ecosystem still felt like a big matrix to me. 
  
The serverless Stack https://serverless-stack.com/ is the first project that helps me to understand AWS, I spent about a week
following the tutorial, and implemented a note app in my own account.
  
Then I go ahead to finish my full-stack business website for a friend of mine. I used lambda, apiGateway, and dynamodb for the 
admin page to persist backend data. At this point, I only know these technologies that I used, without a clue how EC2,
VPC, Subnets ect, work with each other.
  
I decided it is time to follow structured tutorial to cover the whole map of AWS. Consecutively, I followed these three course:
  
  1. AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner by IAAS ACADEMY
  2. AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate by Rick Crisci
  3. AWS Certified Developer Associate by Stephane Maarek
  
The majority of the courses' content are conceptual, except that the last one provides quite a lot of hands on activity 
using amazon console. A lot of new concepts, and how each of them work together with each other. I sat through one course soon
after another, because I like to see how different instructors explain them differently, and reinforce the concepts, working them from 
short term memory to long term memory. It took me about 3 weeks to finish these three courses,from September 8th to September 27th, 
the day I passed the first AWS test, Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. 

The CCP badge is an encouragement to move forward.
