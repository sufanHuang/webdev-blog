#### I Passed AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate Exam  
  
  
October 26th marked the official date of me receiving the badge for "AWS Certified Solution Architect-Associate".
I think it deserves a journal log.

As I mentioned in [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](awsCCP.html) article, getting the first amazon badge was 
quite an encouragement, but it is far from enough. At the end of September,, I felt myself entering the matrix of AWS. 
I am able to recognize, name, and talk about the basic concept of most AWS services. In my understanding they were still 
tangled together with each other, like those unsorted clothes just out from dryer. I feel an urge to know what each of them
do, how they relate to each and what kind of logic behind them.

These are the steps I took from 30th of september to 25th of October:

* Read AWS books on Kindle that interests me, which includes:
  1. Top 50 AWS Associate Architect Interview Questions and Answers by Knowledge Powerhouse
  2. AWS Certified Solutions Architect 2019 Practice by Chandra Prakash Busam
* Explore AWS FQAS of different services.
* Follow Amazon re:invent talks on VPC, S3, EC2, DynamoDb, Lambda, Cloudformation, etc.
* Read documentation and watch youtube videos on topics including: IP network, TCP/IP, router, switch, firewalls,hubs, subnet, network
security.
* Read the aws-sdk documentation, make two CRUD projects using dynamodb, apiGateway, lambda and serverless framework. 

And on 26th of October, I went to the test room with some confidence as well as anxiety.

I jumped up and down when sharing the result to my families, it was a recognition of another month of study of progressing.
