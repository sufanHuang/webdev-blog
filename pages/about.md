This site is a blog where I write about my learning journey as a web developer.

I have a background of foreign language learning and teaching. I've always interested in different 
languages as a little kid. Living in south China at the first two decades of my life, I grew up with three languages. 
Hakka dialect is spoken locally, Mandarin Chinese is used at school and all the formal settings, TV and entertainment
are mostly in Cantonese. We got used to switch back and forth between languages when trying to be more accurately expressing
ourselves.When I started to learn English in forth grade, I was amazed at the fact that 
how Chinese and English have different alphabets and sounds, but at the end, trying to convey the same 
human experience.

I continued my higher-education in languages. I studied linguistic theories of languages, and the cultural
interaction that impact natural language development. The first time I encountered machine language was in my
freshman year in University. I loved that programing language is logical and functional, while natural languages have always exceptions
because of dealing with unsolvable human problems. On looking back, I wished I have had grasped that enthusiasm and
dived into programming language. 

Fast forward, life has brought me to the other side of the world. I landed my first job as a teacher, a job that 
I always been interested in. I tried all kinds of methods to help my students to learn a language that has no context
in their daily life. And to keep them involved and to individualized each student's learning experience, I found 
myself exploring more and more on technology resources. One day I realized that I've turned my classroom into a hybrid 
learning environment, couple learning websites were built.

I didn't stop there. I feel like I have open the door of another field that I have always wanted to explore, and maybe 
it is about time to find out what is behind the big world-wide-web.

I started from basic computer science concepts: data structure, data type, algorithm. And then html, css, javascript.
It overwhelmed me the first six months. I realized that I might have to reorganized my life to be able to spend more time
on it to understand how those concepts relate to each other. 

It is very easy to put up a website using modern web kits like wordpress, weebly platform, etc. It is another story if you dive
into it. It is like making a coffee is easy, but to call yourself a profession "coffee maker", you need to have the knowledge of
different types of beans, where the beans come from, how do you grind them, how to control the water temperature, how to 
mix different ingredients, what ingredients to add. The list is endless......

I quit my teaching job at June 2018, giving myself no way back but to march forward in learning programming.

And when I am able to keep my head above the water, I started this blog. I wanted it to be a journal as well as a place 
to share with fellows who find themselves in the same road.
