                       <p>** October 26th marked the official date of me receiving the badge for "AWS Certified Solution Architect-Associate".
                  I like to wrapped up by writing the first post on my new blog website.</p>
                <p><img src="images/solution-architect-associate.png" alt="saa" /></p>
                <p>I started to realize the importance of official certifications/credential on my resume, after going to a Hacker
                  event at the end of Auguest. There are couple things that pushed me forward: 1. Almost all the company onsite are using
                  cloud technology, mostly AWS in one way or another. 2. I have Liberal Art degrees, and working as a teacher in a professional
                  level is not very convincing that I have the mindset in technical field. </p>
                <p>Prior to make the decision of diving into AWS, I have make a simple project using AWS lambda, dynamoDb, apiGate way. It took
                  me a whole month to figure out different parts and how to put them together using serverless framework. Even after the project,
                  the AWS ecosystem still feels like a big matrix to me. </p>
                <p>The serverless Stack https://serverless-stack.com/ is the first project that helps me to understand AWS, I spent about a week
                  following the tutorial, and implemented a note app in my own account.</p>
                <p>Then I go ahead to finish my full-stack business website for a friend of my. I use lambda, apiGateway, and dynamodb for the
                  administrator page to persist backend data. At this point, I only know these technologies that I used, without a clue how EC2,
                  VPC, Subnets ect, work with each other.</p>
                <p>Then I started to find some structure tutorial to cover the whole road map of AWS. Consecutively, I followed these three course:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner by IAAS ACADEMY</p></li>
                <li><p>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate by Rick Crisci</p></li>
                <li><p>AWS Certified Developer Associate by Stephane Maarek</p>
                <p>The majority of the courses content are conceptual learning, except the last tutorial provides quite a lot of hands on activity
                using amazon console. A lot of new concepts, and how each of them work together with each other. I continued one course soon
                after another because I like to see how different instructors explain them differently, and reinforce the concepts for me at
                the same time. It took me about 3 weeks to sit through these three courses,from September 8th to September 27th, the day I
                passed the first AWS test, Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. </p>
                <p>At this time, I felt myself enter the matrix of AWS. I am able to recognize and name those service. But I wanted to know more.
                These are the steps I took going forward:</p></li>
                <li><p>Read AWS books on my Kindle that interests me, which includes:
                 a. Top 50 AWS Associate Architect Interview Questions and Answers by Knowledge Powerhouse
                 b. AWS Certified Solutions Architect 2019 Practice by Chandra Prakash Busam</p></li>
                <li><p>Read the AWS FQAS of different services.</p></li>
                <li><p>Follow Amazon re:invent talks focusing on VPC, S3, DYNAMODB, CLOUDFORMATION, etc. It is interested to hear from the engineers who
                 participated in the making of these services.</p></li>
                <li><p>Make a todo-backend and a blog-backend using serverless. These projects make me read the aws-sdk documentation and figure out
                 how to find information and write code. </p>
                <p>And on 26th of October, I went to the test room with confidence as well as anxiety. But I really feel like expending my knowledge
                greatly in one month of studying, and exited to test my learning by entering the center. </p></li>
                </ol>
