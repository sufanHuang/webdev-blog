            <p>This site is a blog where I write about my learning journey as a web developer.</p>
            <p>I have a background of foreign language learning and teaching. I've always interested in different
            languages as a little kid. Growing up in south China, I grew up with three languages. Hakka dialect
            is spoken locally, Mandarin Chinese is used at school and all the formal settings, TV and entertainment
            are mostly in Cantonese. When I started to learn English in forth grade, I was amazed at the fact that
            how Chinese and English have different alphabets and sounds, but at the end, trying to convey the same
            human experience.</p>
            <p>I continued my higher-education in languages. I studied the linguistic theories of languages, and the cultural
            interaction that impact natural language development. The first time I encountered machine language was in my
            freshman year in University. I loved that how programing language can be so logical and functional. On looking
            back, I wished I have had grasped that enthusiasm and dived into one programming language. </p>
            <p>Fast forward, life has brought me to the other side of the world. I landed my first job as a teacher, a job that
            I always been interested in. I tried all kinds of methods to help my students to learn a language that has no context
            in their daily life. And to keep them involved and to individualized each student's learning experience, I found
            myself exploring more and more on technology resources. Only find out one day I turned my classroom total into a hybrid
            learning environment and built couple learning websites for my students.</p>
            <p>I didn't stop there. I feel like I have open the door of another field that I have always wanted to explore, and maybe
            it is about time to find out what the world-wide-web is made of.</p>
            <p>I started from the basic computer science concepts: data structure, data type, algorithm. And then html, css, javascrip.
            It overwhelmed me the first six months. I realized that I might have to reorganized my life to be able to spend more time
            on it to understand how those concepts relate to each other. </p>
            <p>It is very easy to put up a website using modern web kits like wordpress, weebly platform, etc. It is another story if you dive
            into it. It is like making a coffee is easy, but to call yourself a profession coffee maker, you need to have the knowledge of
            different types of beans, where do the beans come from, how do you grind them, how to control the water temperature, how to
            mix different ingredients, what ingredients to add. You find yourself an big vast of pool to swim over with.</p>
            <p>I quit my teaching job at June 2018, giving myself no way back but to march forward in learning programming.</p>
            <p>And when I am able to keep my head above the water, I started this blog. I wanted it to be a journal as well as a place
            to share with fellows who find themselves in the same road.</p>
