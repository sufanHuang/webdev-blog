       <p>This blog where I write about my learning journey as web developer.</p>
<p>Having been an elementary school teacher, I have a background of foreign language learning and teaching. 
I have always been interested in different languages as a little kid. Living in south China for two decades of my life,
I grew up with three languages. Hakka dialect spoken locally, Mandarin Chinese used at school and all the formal settings, 
while TV and entertainment were mostly in Cantonese. We got used to switch back and forth between languages all the time.
When I started to learn English in fourth grade, I was amazed at fact how Chinese and English have different alphabets 
and sounds, but at the end, trying to convey same ideas.</p>
<p>I continued my higher-education in languages. I studied linguistic theories and cultural interactions that impact 
natural language development. The first time I encountered machine language was in my freshman year in University. 
I loved that programing language is logical and functional, while natural languages have always had exceptions because 
of dealing with unsolvable human problems. On looking back, I wished I have had grasped that enthusiasm and dived 
into a programming language.</p>
<p>Fast forward, my life has brought me to the other side of the world. I landed my first job as a teacher, a job that 
I always been interested in. I tried all kinds of methods to help my students to learn a language that has no context 
in their daily life as Chinese language teacher. And to keep them involved and to individualized each student's learning
experience I found myself exploring more and more on technology resources. One day I realized that I've turned my 
classroom into a hybrid learning environment, couple learning websites were built.</p>
<p>I didn't stop there. I feel like I have open the door of another field that I have always wanted to explore, and maybe 
it is about time to find out what is behind the big world-wide-web.</p>
<p>I started from basic computer science concepts: data structure, data type, algorithm. And then html, css, javascript. 
It overwhelmed me the first six months. I realized that I might have to reorganized my life to be able to spend more 
time on it to understand how those concepts relate to each other.</p>
<p>It is very easy to put up a website using modern web kits like wordpress, weebly platform, etc. It is another story 
if you dive into it. It is like making a coffee is easy, but to call yourself a profession "coffee maker", you need to 
have the knowledge of different types of beans, where the beans come from, how do you grind them, how to control the 
water temperature, how to mix different ingredients, what ingredients to add. The list is endless……</p>
<p>I quit my teaching job at June 2018, giving myself no way back but to march forward in learning programming.</p>
<p>And when I am able to keep my head above the water, I started this blog. I wanted it to be a journal as well as a place 
to share with fellows who find themselves in the same path.</p>
