<p>I received an invitation to go to a recruiting event from HackerX on Auguest 29th, 2019. I updated my portfolio site
and  printed out around 10 copies of resume, together with some anxiety and curiosity, I
arrived on time.</p>
<p>I didn't draw a big picture for myself, but carried with an attitude of finding out what technologies are popular in
Des Moines, as well as how far I am compared with their ideal candidates. </p>
<p>I talked to around 6 employer on site. There two things I found out: 1. Everyone is using cloud technology, with AWS
as the more popular one. 2. The employers are interested in my attitude and the scope of technology I knew about,
but they are not quite sure of my coding skill. </p>
<p>This is a very important action piece in my journey of becoming a professional web development. I gave myself some time to think
it through and set two goals: 1. Take AWS exams and get couple certifications. 2. Continue to make projects and start
to document the thinking process as well as problem solving process. </p>
<p>Prior to this decision of diving into AWS, I have make a simple project using AWS lambda, dynamoDb, apiGate way. It took
me a whole month to figure out different parts and how to put them together using serverless framework. Even after this project,
the AWS ecosystem still felt like a big matrix to me. </p>
<p>The serverless Stack https://serverless-stack.com/ is the first project that helps me to understand AWS, I spent about a week
following the tutorial, and implemented a note app in my own account.</p>
<p>Then I go ahead to finish my full-stack business website for a friend of mine. I used lambda, apiGateway, and dynamodb for the
admin page to persist backend data. At this point, I only know these technologies that I used, without a clue how EC2,
VPC, Subnets ect, work with each other.</p>
<p>I decided it is time to follow structured tutorial to cover the whole map of AWS. Consecutively, I followed these three course:</p>
<ol>
<li>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner by IAAS ACADEMY</li>
<li>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate by Rick Crisci</li>
<li>AWS Certified Developer Associate by Stephane Maarek</li>
</ol>
<p>The majority of the courses' content are conceptual, except that the last one provides quite a lot of hands on activity
using amazon console. A lot of new concepts, and how each of them work together with each other. I sat through one course soon
after another, because I like to see how different instructors explain them differently, and reinforce the concepts, working them from
short term memory to long term memory. It took me about 3 weeks to finish these three courses,from September 8th to September 27th,
the day I passed the first AWS test, Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. </p>
<p>The CCP badge is an encouragement to move forward.</p>
